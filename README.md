# Medical-inventory-optimization
Managing medical inventory is a critical aspect of healthcare operations. Efficient inventory management ensures that medical facilities are well-equipped to provide care without interruptions, avoid overstocking, and minimize waste. With vast amounts of data generated daily from inventory usage, procurement, and supply chain activities, effective visualization is essential to derive actionable insights. This project aims to develop dashboards that provide comprehensive insights into medical inventory management, helping to optimize stock levels and streamline operations.
